# Kolor_Krusher-Express
=======
-Game for teaching and practicing CSS. Each round will cover a different concept:

ROUND 1: Select the correct RGB color value.

ROUND 2: Use buttons to apply CSS flex-box properties to elements. Make your shapes look like the example.

ROUND 3: Use buttons to apply CSS grid properties to elements. Make your shapes look like the example.

-Scoring will be based on a timer that starts at 15 seconds. On selecting the correct choice the remaining time will be added to the players score. Accuracy is rewarded with "crypto coins" which are not only added to the players score but are accumulated and can be used to 'upgrade' your character.
