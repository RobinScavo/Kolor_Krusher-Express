'>SHIMMERING COINS</h3>

&emsp;To create the shifting silver effect on the coins and bowls I started with an image of silver foil, made it much bigger than the circle displaying it, hid the overflow and then started slowly moving the background image.

    overflow: hidden;

'>ANIMATIONS</h3>

&emsp;The timer in the upper left will flip and fall into the bowl below it whenever a player correctly guesses a color. The 'crypto coins' in the upper right will do the same, in addition to rolling off screen when the player chooses unwisely. These animations were accomplished by adding and removing class names with React and utilizing @keyframes in the CSS files.

'> ~ What I learned ~ </h2>

**1) CSS-** Responsiveness to screen size should be considered early and often when planning your application. While flexbox works great at component level, using the grid method for the layout makes it much easier to prioritize what gets displayed at various screen sizes.

**2) React-** Completing this project really drove home the importance of seperating concerns in state management. In Cotroller.js, I essentially created a 'brain' which does most of the thinking for the application (Its the only component that's a class instead of a function. This was a personal preference for readability). In essence, its a big switch board that sends out the ability to toggle those switches to other components. This centralization lead to unecessary rerendering and its something that I need to correct.

&emsp;I also realized the importance of removing state from the components that get rendered in order to improve reusability and testing. I found it much better to handle state in a parent component and then prop-thread needed information and functions down to the 'minions'.

**3) Firebase-** When learning full stack development I think its best to start with a tool like Firebase which simplifies Authentication and CRUD actions. This will allow students to see the overall forest of web development before focusing on specific trees like Express.

**4) Modals-** I experimented with 3 different ways to implement modals: ReactDOM.createPortal (which renders children in DOM node existing outside the DOM hieracrchy), flash messaging (which uses a pattern similar to Redux), and directly manipulating the DOM with conditional rendering. I prefer the first method.

**5) Personally-** This project confirmed my suspicions that my interests and talents lie in front-end development. However, I now have enough understanding of the back-end to build a simple one (or collaborate and communicate with people smart enough to build a complex one).

<h2 style='
    font-family:luminari;
    font-size: 25px;
    display:flex;
    justify-content:center;
    align-items:center;
    color: rgb(87, 189, 227);
'> ~ To-Do list ~ </h2>

&emsp;As you read above, the unneccessary rerendering of components is unacceptable and I plan to refactor into a component map like the one below. The creation and rendering of color balls is a concern that needs to be BELOW the overall game and navigation logic. I also need to futher remove state from any component which is being rendered and pass this responsiblity to parent components. The only two components being rendered which need an internal state are the 'scoreTimer.js' (which internally counts down) and the 'leftConvertPanel' (which does input verification).

&emsp;I greatly enjoy using the tools provided to us by Google and Firebase was no exception. I plan to become more acquainted with all the things it offers such as image hosting and cloud services. I have some familiarity with Express so my next project will combine the two. I also intend to explore Material UI... now that I've built my own components I'll see what the libraries can bring to the table.

&emsp;If you read this far then I sincerely appreciate your interest. Feel free to email me with advice, questions, job offers or just to nerd-out with me about math or colors or whatever.
